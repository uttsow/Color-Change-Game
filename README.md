# Color-Change-Game

A simple color change game I made for my very first time programming. The idea is simple, you are given a game GUI and a word appear defining a color. However the word will be a different color itself. For example, if the word is Blue, the color of the letters will be something random. 

The objective of the game is to type as many words as possible before the timer runs out
